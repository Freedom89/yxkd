> GA has some of the best TAs I have seen in OMSCS! It is extremely well run and organized.
> 
> My Favorite TAs are **Jamie McPeek** (subjective to some people) and Emily Lentz - Jamie being the most active in Ed among all TAs and if you spend time to properly phrase your thoughts and confusion (and doing your research before asking), he is quite patient and helpful. That being said, do not expect him to spoonfed you, his responses are done in such a way to encourage you to arrive at the conclusion yourself; a true educator.
>
> And **Emily Lentz** for always listening to student feedback regarding the ambiguous questions (or wrong answers post grades) and following up to get full credit for all students :smile:
