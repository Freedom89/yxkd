> GA has some of the best TAs I have seen in OMSCS! It is extremely well run and organized.
> 
> My Favorite TAs are **Jamie McPeek** (subjective to some people) and **Emily Lentz** - Jamie being the most active in Ed among all the TAs. In my opinion - If you spend time to properly phrase your thoughts and confusion (and doing your research before asking), Jamie is very patient and helpful. However do not expect him to spoonfed you, his responses are done in such a way to encourage you to arrive at the conclusion yourself; a true educator.
>
> Also **Emily Lentz** for always listening to student feedback regarding the ambiguous questions (or wrong answers post grades) and rectifying them, as well as actively responding to student regrade requests and helping students to get their marks back! :smile:

Correct > Complete > Concise!
