## Background

A long time ago (back in 2013) during a summer internship, I realize that University's education is not sufficient for workplace. The idea then was to study as much as I can, improve as fast as I can, gobbling up materials. 

The end result is I ended up not learning anything, mainly due to not internalizing the content (touch and go). This blog serves as a personal reminder to document the things I have learnt, plus forces me to write the content in a way that is succinct and a personal knowledge based in cold storage :joy:.

## Framework 

The next question becomes - **What to study or focus on then?** - choosing what to study has a larger impact and consequence? A common interview question was always:

> Where do you see yourself in 5 years time?
>

And whatever answer I had for myself in 5 years time, was no longer true within the next year. I decided to use a different approach, that is to treat myself as a product, focusing on 3 major (personal) pain points in the current year to set as my goals for the next year.

Why 3?
* Something to rotate around incase I am bored 
* Allows me to focus!

Overall, this has been working well for me so far - definitely space for improvements! 

## 2025

Goal: 

Finished my masters, got a new role (within the same company). 

* Work on my health and fitness (that took a backseat during the past 3 years)
* Improve my engineering skills
* Catch up on LLM (that I missed out the entire cycle since the release of GPT in 2022)

Rejected Goals:
* 3D printing
* Robotics 

## 2024 

Busy with [OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/)

## 2023

Busy with [OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/)

## 2022

Gotten a new job, and wish to work more on my data & statistical skills! These are my (undecided) goals so far, in the order of priority :smile:

* Spend time on ML, in particular regression, d-trees, and bayesian statistics.
* Get better at data structures.
* Explore the SWE stack and practice data structures.
* Pick up neural network / graphical related technologies.
* Uncertain about other techniques, like time series, ranking, recommendations, computer vision, nlp, reinforcement learning etc.
* Deciding whether to enroll in an online masters or not (?)

> I ended up taking [OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) starting in Fall 2022, and completed it in Fall 2024! 

## 2021

Goal:

The odds are someone else has encountered my problem and either the cloud platform has a solution for it or there is some open source tool out there. I should spend more time exploring such tools and evaluate them instead of jumping in directly and build my own.

Solution:

* Invest and upscale my cloud knowledge & tooling. (GCP in particular)
* Understand more on data best practices and explore more open source tools. (Tf-X, MLflow, Feature stores?).
* Understand more on experiments & algorithms. (Just for learning)

In addition, starting this year, I also decided to note down my reflection as well as goals that did not make it to the list!

Reflection:
* Understood cloud build, cloud functions, ai platform better.
* Explored more on apache beam, DBT, fastapi, docker compose.
* Did a post on hypothesis testing, and will double down on this.

Rejected Goals:

* study a new programming language, uncertain whether it should be golang or java
* Try to implement a deep learning use case. 
* Study hardware engineering and build something related to IOT. 

## 2020

Goal:

As my abilities "scaled" (and being able to see things "end-to-end"), I end up getting multiple (conflicting) requests from many teams. I delivered as many of those as I could, but ended up with a huge technical debt and operational overhead. I want to reduce this going forward.

Solution:

* Build my own website as a way of knowledge repository, both for easy recall and sharing. (It was also a way to put what I have learnt into good use.)
* Write better code, understanding typed python, testing, linting, CI/CD.
* Wanted to know more on experiments and a/b testing (I failed this) - but I learnt a lot more on engineering side, such as tooling, Docker etc.


## 2019

Goal:

While I was successful in launching a machine learning model for credit scoring, there were lots of miscommunication and alignment required. I decided to go back to be an Individual Contributor (IC) and wanted to invest more in my engineering skills.

Solution:

* Develop an end-to-end (sounds like a marketing jargon) application that is integrated with the product funnel to be used in production. This would be a true test of "work ready".
* Learn about data streaming processing (real time streaming instead of batch)
* Learn SQL - to use BigQuery (I was the Select * Data Scientist and I dataframe-d everything. )

## 2018

2018 was a very interesting year for me I joined a new company and was (suddenly) responsible for a new product launch.

For that year, I put the company's goals above my own. It was definitely one of the most painful years but highlight of my career there and rewarded handsomely for it!  Also, being a new joiner there was already plenty of tools and process for me to learn! (E.g It was the first time I had to deal with billion rows and using spark was a necessity instead of a proof of concept.)

## 2017

Goal:

I was frustrated being a "Power Point/Dashboard" Data Scientist to someone who is able to deploy models into production.

Solution:

* Get skills in order to find employment in a tech company. (Made the shift in Q4 2017)
* Learn how to build data products.
* Learn Python.


## 2016

Goal:

After trying to master everything, I realize i was chasing hype which resulted in half-baked understanding. I should focus and understand why companies use certain technologies and the "why".

Solution:

* Learn Modeling Intuition (Why use one model over the other?)
* get familiar with Big data stack (Hive, Spark, etc) and the use cases.
* Get familiar with cloud computing and the use cases.
