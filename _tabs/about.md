## Why did i start this site?

Since my undergraduate days, I am fond of digitalizing my summarized notes in order to

1. Aids my personal understanding of a topic.
2. Assist my recollection, and since it is digitalized, it is easy to search and edit!
3. Sharing my notes with my peers which aid their exam preparation, which they in kind help me spot errors or suggest changes or share new insights/knowledge.

In a way, this site is my attempt of recreating something similar as a working professional and my contribution back to the industry.
